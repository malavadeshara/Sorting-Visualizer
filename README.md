## SortingVisualizer Component

The `SortingVisualizer` component is the core of this project. It provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms. Below is an explanation of the component and its functions:

### Functions in SortingVisualizer

1. **`generateArray()`**  
   This function generates a new random array of integers to be sorted. It is typically called when the user wants to reset the array or start a new sorting visualization.

2. **`mergeSort()`**  
   Implements the Merge Sort algorithm. It divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves while visualizing the process.

3. **`quickSort()`**  
   Implements the Quick Sort algorithm. It selects a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions. The visualization highlights the partitioning process.

4. **`bubbleSort()`**  
   Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the array, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The visualization shows the swapping process.

5. **`insertionSort()`**  
   Implements the Insertion Sort algorithm. It builds the sorted array one element at a time by picking elements and placing them in their correct position. The visualization demonstrates the insertion process.

6. **`animateSorting()`**  
   This function handles the animation of the sorting process. It takes the steps generated by the sorting algorithms and animates them on the screen.

7. **`resetArrayColors()`**  
   Resets the colors of the array bars to their default state. This is useful after a sorting visualization is completed or when generating a new array.

8. **`handleSpeedChange(speed)`**  
   Allows the user to adjust the speed of the sorting visualization. It updates the animation delay based on the selected speed.

9. **`handleAlgorithmSelection(algorithm)`**  
   Updates the selected sorting algorithm based on user input. This function ensures the correct algorithm is executed when the user starts the visualization.

### How to Use

1. Generate a new array by clicking the "Generate Array" button.
2. Select a sorting algorithm from the available options.
3. Adjust the speed of the visualization using the speed slider.
4. Click the "Start Sorting" button to visualize the selected algorithm.

This component is designed to be interactive and educational, making it easier to understand how different sorting algorithms work.
